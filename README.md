# Lost Ark Anti-AFK
Small tool to keep you logged into Lost Ark while AFK.

It moves the mouse slightly and clicks either right or left mouse button. This is configurable. It works perfect for Lost Ark and will calculate the position based on your screen width and height. Make sure you enable it after you logged in and close all windows. Best place to go is to your Stronghold on the grass where there is plenty of room.

You can temporarely enable or disable usig the capslock key. The program can be minimized to windows tray and will keep working even without a mouse being connected.

The code is not the prettiest but it works. You can also download the executable. If you want to compile yourself download the code and images and compile using SciTE.
