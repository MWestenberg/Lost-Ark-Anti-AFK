# Lost Ark Anti-AFK
Small tool to keep you logged into Lost Ark while AFK.

I built this tool because of the long queues in Europe where I would log in early in the afternoon to be able to play at night. Since I don't want to move my mouse every now and then or would forget it I made this tool to make sure I could play. Feel free to use/adapt it to your needs or just download the exe and the banner. You can also change the banner as long as you use the same name and put it in the same directory.

It works by moving the mouse slightly left and right and clicks either right or left mouse button (this is configurable). It works perfect for Lost Ark and will calculate the position based on your screen width and height. Make sure you enable it after you logged in and close all windows and open the game using the same resolution as your desktop. Best place to go is to your Stronghold on the grass where there is plenty of room and where no one will notice you.

You can temporarely enable or disable usig the capslock key. The program can be minimized to windows tray and will keep working even without a mouse being connected because it sends a command to the WinAPI.

The code is not the prettiest but it works. You can also download the executable. If you want to compile yourself download the code and images in the src folder and compile using SciTE.
